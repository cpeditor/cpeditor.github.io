description: In this way, you can get the latest unreleased features and get ready for contributing. It needs more steps, and is the only choice if your OS is not officially supported.

1.  Clone this repo and submodules:

    ```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpeditor/cpeditor.git
    cd cpeditor
    ```

2.  Install [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) (5.15 or higher), [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (3.12 or higher) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    -   On some Linux distributions and macOS, you can install from your package manager. For example, `sudo pacman -S qt5` on Arch Linux, `brew install qt5` on macOS.
    -   You can also download the [offline installer](https://www.qt.io/offline-installers), or download from the [mirrors](https://download.qt.io/static/mirrorlist/). The path from the root of the mirror should be like `/qt/official_releases/qt/5.15/5.15.1/qt-opensource-<platform>-5.15.1.<suffix>` (or other versions).
    -   You can also use [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall) to install Qt.

3.  If CMake can't find the Qt installation path, you should set environment variable: `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QtPath%/%QtVersion%/%Compiler%/lib/cmake`. For example, on macOS, you can run something like `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.15.1"`.

4.  Run the following commands:

    -   Linux/macOS:

        ```sh
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
        cmake --build .
        ```

    -   Windows:
        ```bat
         mkdir build
         cd build
         cmake ..
         cmake --build . --config Release
        ```

On Linux, you will get `build/cpeditor`.

On macOS, you will get `build/cpeditor.app`.

On Windows, you will get `build\cpeditor.exe`, or `build\Release\cpeditor.exe`. If there are DLLs missing, you can add `%QtPath%\%QtVersion%\%Compiler%\bin` (for example, `D:\Qt\5.15.1\msvc2019_64\bin`) to the PATH environmental variable.
