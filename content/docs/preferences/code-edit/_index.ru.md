### Tab Width

The width (number of characters) of an indent. It is used when displaying the tab characters. It is also used in [Auto Indent](#auto-indent) and [Replace tabs by spaces](#replace-tabs-by-spaces).

### Auto Indent

1.  When you start a new line, the new line will have the same indent (i.e. white spaces at the beginning of the line) as the old line.
2.  If the old line ends with `{`, an extra indent (a tab character or [Tab Width](#tab-width) spaces, depending on whether [Replace tabs by spaces](#replace-tabs-by-spaces) is enabled) will be inserted at the beginning of the new line.

### Wrap Text

If a line is too long to fit in a single line, the line will be separated into several lines.

### Auto Complete Parentheses

Automatically add the right parenthesis when you type the left one. For example, when you type `(`, `)` will be added.

When the character next to the cursor is a right parenthesis and you type this parenthesis, instead of typing this parenthesis, the cursor will jump out of the parenthesis.

You can choose the parentheses to auto-complete in the [Parentheses](../language/_index.ru.md#parentheses) settings.

### Auto Remove Parentheses

When you delete a left parenthesis, if a corresponding right parenthesis is next to it, the right parenthesis will also be deleted.

You can choose the parentheses to auto-remove in the [Parentheses](../language/_index.ru.md#parentheses) settings.

### Jump out of a parenthesis by pressing Tab

When the cursor is next to a right parenthesis, you can use the Tab key to jump out of it. If [Auto Complete Parentheses](#auto-complete-parentheses) is enabled, this is an alternative of typing the right parenthesis.

You can choose the parentheses to jump out by Tab in the [Parentheses](../language/_index.ru.md#parentheses) settings.

### Replace tabs by spaces

When you insert an indent, insert spaces instead of a tab character. The number of spaces is equal to the [Tab Width](#tab-width).

Note that this won't replace the existing tab characters. In [Auto Indent](#auto-indent), the tab characters in the old line will remain in the new line (however, the new indent inserted after `{` will be spaces).
