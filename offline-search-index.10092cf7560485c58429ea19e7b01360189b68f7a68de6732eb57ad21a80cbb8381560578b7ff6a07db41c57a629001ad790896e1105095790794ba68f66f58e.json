For example, you may want to add -std=c++14 in the compile command to use C++14.\nC++ Executable File Path The path of the executable file, i.e. the argument of the -o option of the compiler.\nIf this path is a relative path, then it’s relative to the source file (if it’s an untitled tab, then relative to the Temporary Directory).\nYou can use some place holders for this setting:\n ${filename}: The complete name of the source file. If it’s an untitled tab (i.e. an unsaved file), the complete file name is sol.cpp. ${basename}: ${filename} without the suffix (i.e. without .cpp, etc.). ${tmpdir} or ${tempdir}: The path of the Temporary Directory.  For example, you can use ${tmpdir}/${basename} if you don’t want to keep the executable files, or executables/${basename} if you want to keep all executable files in the executables directory in the parent directory of the source file.\nC++ Run Arguments The arguments passed to the program when executing it.

Offset characters: a number, could be negative.  It works as below:\n Find the first match of the regex in the template. If nothing matches the regex, the cursor will be at the end of the template. Otherwise, depending on the offset type, the cursor will be at the start/end of the first match, and then moved to the right by the number of the offset characters.  For example, if your template contains the following snippet:\nint main() { } Then you can use int main as the regex, end as the offset type, and 9 as the offset characters.

Download Eclipse.JDT.ls, extract it to any location (in a new directory), We call the path to that directory \u003cINSTALL_PATH\u003e (Something like C://Users/Myname/Desktop/EclipseJDT.ls/). In CP Editor, go to Preferences -\u003e Extensions -\u003e Language Server -\u003e Java Server.

If java complains about “jar not found”, then look for the latest version of the org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_* jar in \u003cINSTALL_PATH\u003e/plugins and replace it in the command after -jar.\nPython Server You need to have python and pip installed and added to PATH.

The first regex matches the whole input file name, and the second pattern is a replacement pattern which is the name of the answer file.\nFor example, you can use (.+)\\.in and \\1.out to match test-1.in and test-1.out, or use (.+)\\.in\\.(\\d+) and \\1.ans.\\2 to match test.in.3 and test.ans.3.\nWhen loading pairs of test cases, each rule which matches an input file will be used to try to find the corresponding answer file to the input file.\nProblem URL Default File Path For Problem URLs The default path when choosing where to save an untitled tab with problem URL.\nEach rule is a pair of regular expression patterns.

You are asked to choose the path for “Load Single Test Case”, the default path is /a/c, and you choose /a/d as the path. Now file is still /a/b, but testcase is changed to /a/d. You are asked to choose the path for “Save File”, the default path is /a/b, and you choose /a/e as the path. Now both file and testcase are /a/e.
